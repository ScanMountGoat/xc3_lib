Rust libraries and tools for working with rendering related file formats for Xenoblade Chronicles X, Xenoblade Chronicles 1 DE, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.

Report any bugs or request new features in [issues](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/issues). Download precompiled binaries for the tools in [releases](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/releases). Python bindings for xc3_model are available with [xc3_model_py](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_model_py). See the [xenoblade rendering research website](https://scanmountgoat.github.io/xenoblade-rendering-research/) for information on topics related to in game rendering.

## Formats
xc3_lib supports a number of in game formats. All formats support reading. Write support is still a WIP for some formats. Click on the links to open the corresponding Rust module in xc3_lib. Extensions starting with `wi` are for the Switch like `wimdo` or `wismt`. Extensions starting with `pc` are for PC builds like `pcmdo` or `pcsmt`. Extensions starting with `ca` are for the Wii U like `camdo` or `casmt`.

### Binaries
- [xc3_gltf](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/tree/main/xc3_gltf) - convert models and maps to glTF
- [xc3_test](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/tree/main/xc3_test) - test against files in an extracted dump
- [xc3_tex](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/tree/main/xc3_tex) - convert textures to and from common formats and replace textures in `wilay` and `wimdo` files
- [xc3_viewer](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/tree/main/xc3_viewer) - simple model viewer for testing `xc3_wgpu`
- [xc3_wgpu_batch](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/tree/main/xc3_wgpu_batch) - batch render models and maps to PNG

## Usage
These projects are still highly unstable. When using the latest version from github, specify a specific git revision or commit the Cargo.lock file to source control. This locks the version and avoids any breaking changes. The debug or JSON output has not stabilized and should not be assumed to be the same between commits.

```toml
xc3_model = { git = "https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib", rev = "commit_hash" }
xc3_wgpu = { git = "https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib", rev = "commit_hash" }
xc3_lib = { git = "https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib", rev = "commit_hash" }
```

## Building
After installing the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), run `cargo build --release` in the repository directory to build the tools to `target/release`.
Running `cargo build` without the `--release` will result in faster compile times during development but dramatically worse runtime performance. The tools can also be run using `cargo run --release -p <project> <args>`. xc3_tex uses [image_dds](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/image_dds), which supports Windows x86, Linux x86, MacOS x86, and MacOS Apple Silicon due to using precompiled kernels for DDS encoding. Other projects should build on other platforms without issues.
